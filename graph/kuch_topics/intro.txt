graph ->  graph is nothing but connected of set of nodes and edges

 n = nodes
 e = edges

 notes -->  there have any nodes and edges there is a graph every thing is a graph 

 type of graph ->
 0. complete graph -> all the node are directly connected each and every node :
 1. directed 
 2. undirected
 3. directed weighted graph 
 4. undirected weighted graph 
 5. cyclic graph -> you have more than 1 path between two nodes in the graph then there must be a cyclic:
 6. acyclic graph -> you have less than 2 path between two nides in the grph then there must ba a acyclic:
 7. conncected graph -> the node are connnected one node to another from any path that is connected graph :
 8. disconnected graph -> you cannot go all node that is disconneted graph 

 9. cycle -> your start and ending point are same and these node are not cyclic more than two times 

 10. simple graph -> graph does not have self loop , multiple edges -> having more than one edges b/w two nodes 

 11. bridge and articulation ->  bridge-> if i remove edges from node the component split of graph in equal to 2 that is bridge , articulation-> a node which  i one remove the component split into more than 1 componenet: edges connected of this node already removed 


 ** common result 
   -->   the sum of all degree of graph is even 




 * Notes --> you not given graph is directed or undirected you assume that undirected graph
